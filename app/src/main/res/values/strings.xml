    <!--    Safety tips -->
    <string name="safety_tip_1">If walking by yourself, get off your cell phone.Chatting can distract you, it\'s better to be aware of your surroundings.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_2">If walking by yourself, hold your cell phone and be ready to make an emergency call.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_3">Look underneath your car before approaching it in a parking garage or lot at night.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_4">If you return to your car and see that a van is parked right next to the driver\'s side, enter through the passenger side. Predators often use vans and will disguise it as a family car.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_5"> You return to your car and it has a flat tire. Back away. Return to wherever you came from (restaurant, store, etc) and call for help. Once assistance arrives, approach your car.
    If someone comes up to you (even if they are a woman) and wants to offer help, politely say, "No thank you." If a man, he could be a predator. If a woman, she could be the lurer.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_6">When the pharmacist asks you to confirm your home address, whisper it to them. Broadcasting your home address among strangers on the line could compromise your safety.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_7">If you\'re checking in to a hotel room, if the person at the front desk says your room number out loud, ask them to give you a new room and write the number on a piece of paper. Or when you check-in, ask upfront that they not say your room number out loud.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_8">When traveling, do not walk with your map in your hand. It is a dead giveaway that you are a tourist. Therefore, you are an easy target.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_9">If you call for room service, and you get a knock on your door, do not immediately open. Ask: "Who is it?" Make the person on the other side of the door tell you who they are before you open it.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_10">When asking for directions and someone offers to show you the way by having you follow them, do not go. Just ask for them to point you in the right direction. Often, predators just want to get you to a place less crowded where your screams can\'t be heard.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_11">If someone tries to grab you, twist your arm up and down and yell, "Stop!" Do anything you can to draw attention to yourself.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_12">Always pour your own drink at a party and bring it with you everywhereâ€¦ even to the bathroom. This will make it a lot harder for someone to drug you via you drink.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_13">If someone is chasing after you, run away in a zig zag pattern. This will exhaust your attacker.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_14">Don\'t check-in on Facebook when you arrive somewhere. Instead, check in as you leave. This way no one will be able to digitally stalk you and know your every move or when you\'re not home. Along the same lines, avoid tweeting or Facebooking from vacation, especially if your account is public, as it\'s a way of letting the world know that your home is unoccupied.</string>
